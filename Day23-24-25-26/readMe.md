-- Docker Summary

Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers.

Key Concepts:
    Image: A lightweight, read-only template used to create containers. It includes the application code and dependencies.

    Container: A running instance of an image. It is isolated, portable, and includes everything needed to run an application.

    Dockerfile: A script with instructions to build a Docker image.

    Docker Hub: A cloud-based registry to share and store Docker images.

    Volume: A mechanism for persistent storage in containers.

    Network: Allows containers to communicate with each other or with external services.
