Linux Concepts Summary

User Permissions:
Linux controls access using three types of users—Owner, Group, and Others—with read, write, and execute rights. Permissions can be viewed and modified to control who can do what on files and directories.

User Management:
Users can be created, deleted, and managed with commands. Passwords are set or changed to secure accounts.

Soft Link vs Hard Link:
Soft links are like shortcuts pointing to files and break if the original file is deleted. Hard links are additional directory entries pointing to the same file data and remain valid even if the original is deleted.

Linux Architecture:
Linux has two main spaces: User Space where applications run, and Kernel Space which manages hardware and system resources. System calls act as a bridge between them.

Working with Files:
Basic operations include creating, viewing, editing, copying, moving, and deleting files using command-line tools.

Text Editors (Nano & Vim):
Nano is simple and beginner-friendly with easy commands. Vim is a powerful editor with different modes allowing efficient text editing.
